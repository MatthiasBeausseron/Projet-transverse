# Projet-transverse
## Presentation
In this project we were quite free but had some restrictions. Which was, use pygame and have physical curves. To realise these conditions we choosed to create a game of type "Super Smash Bros", we called it "Super Bro-Ject". <br>
You'll find in this document: <br>
* In the file [commits.md](), also called log book, a small description of all our added code in function of time. Then you'll be able to go in [commits](https://github.com/MatthiasBeausseron/Projet-transverse/commits/main) and see the code added in link of the commit.

* Here is the game in a [dmg]() or [exe]() version to allow you to play. <br>
In the case it don't work, please install pygame download the code and run the file [main.py]()<br>
* This is our final [report]() for the project<br>
## Classes and object oriented code
We used class in our project to make the code more readable and clean. Sometimes the result were the opposit but we were happy to learn the basis of using class.
