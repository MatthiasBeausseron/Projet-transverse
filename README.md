# Presentation
In this project we were quite free but had some restrictions. Which was, use pygame and have physical curves. To realise these conditions we choosed to create a "Super Smash Bros" like game, we called it "Super Bro-Ject". <br>
You will find in this document: <br>
* In the file [commits.md](https://github.com/MatthiasBeausseron/Projet-transverse/blob/main/Commits.md), also called log book, a small description of all our added code in function of time. Then you will be able to go in [commits](https://github.com/MatthiasBeausseron/Projet-transverse/commits/main) and see the code added in link of the commit.

* Here is the game in a [dmg]() or [exe]() version to allow you to play. <br>
In the case it don't work, please install pygame download the code and run the file [main.py](https://github.com/MatthiasBeausseron/Projet-transverse/blob/main/main.py)<br>
* This is our final [report]() for the project<br>

## Code
We used class in our project to make the code more legible and clean. Sometimes the result were the opposit but we were happy to learn the basis of using class.<br>
